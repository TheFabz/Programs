                Another writing challenge can be to take the individual sentences in the random paragraph and incorporate 
                a single sentence from that into a new paragraph to create a short story. Unlike the random sentence generator, 
                the sentences from the random paragraph will have some connection to one another so it will be a bit different. 
                You also won't know exactly how many sentences will appear in the random paragraph.
            </p>

                Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get their creative flow going 
                at the beginning of the day. The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about 
                when it appears. This forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common writing challenges. 
                The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story and build upon it. A second option is to 
                use the random paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to have the random 
                paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No matter which of these challenges is undertaken, 
                the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing.
